mySQL employee tracker
I think you'll appreciate the dynamic code i used, meaning i'm reading all the roles or all the employees before asking which employee or role to update.  Therefore if i just added a new department i can still use that new department when i add a role.  I have a feeling some people just hard coded all the departments and roles. Maybe not, but this guy works.  See link for application demo.
